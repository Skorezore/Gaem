# Gaem

Absolutely the best gaem on earth, if it exists.

## Requirements

A working build of standard-compliant curses.<br />
Recommended are [ncurses](http://bfy.tw/xfD) on Linux-based OSes and [PDcurses](http://bfy.tw/xfM) on Windows

## Binaries

For those who don't want to bother having to compile from source, we have Windows 64-bit [binaries](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rqftmlpp3ez3hig/Gaem.exe?dl=1) that you may download. Just be warned that they won't always be up to date.
